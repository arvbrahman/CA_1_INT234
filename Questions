Q.1 You are provided with a CSV file ‘survey_data’ containing raw survey data with missing values, inconsistent data formats, and erroneous entries.
(a) Write the R code to import the CSV file and inspect the first few rows.
(b) Identify and replace missing values in the dataset with appropriate methods such as mean, median, or mode, and explain your choice.

Q.2 Write R code to implement the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm on a dataset of “diamonds” (from ggplot2 package). Include the steps for:
(a) Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
(b) Applying the KNN model.
(c) Evaluating the performance using accuracy or confusion matrix.

Q.3 The airquality dataset contains daily air quality measurements in New York from May to September 1973, with columns such as Ozone, Solar.R (solar radiation), Wind, Temp, Month, and Day.
(a) Display the Ozone and Temp values for days in the month of July (Month = 7).
(b) Write an sqldf query to group the data by Month and calculate the average Wind speed for each month.
(c) Display the total number of days where Ozone levels were above 100.
(d) Write a query to select the average Temp for days with Wind speed greater than 10, grouping by Month.

Q.1 Given a dataset mtcars in R, implement the following: normalize the numeric values in the dataset for ‘am’ attribute, replace 1 and 0 with the labels yes and no respectively
 
Q.2 Consider wine dataset apply KNN and check the accuracy of the model. Divide the 80% dataset as a training data and 20% as testing data.

Q.3 The ToothGrowth dataset examines the effect of vitamin C on tooth growth in guinea pigs, with variables len (tooth length), supp (type of supplement: VC or OJ), and dose (dose of supplement in mg).
(a) Display the len (tooth length) and supp (supplement) values for guinea pigs that received a dose of 2 mg.
(b) Write an sqldf query to group the data by supp and calculate the average len for each supplement group.
(c) Display the total number of guinea pigs that have a len greater than 20.
(d) Write a query to select the average len for guinea pigs that received a dose of more than 1 mg, grouping by supp.
